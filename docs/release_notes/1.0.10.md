# 1.0.10

- Hardened iOS build-number generation to always pick a value higher than any existing App Store or TestFlight build when production deploys run from CI.
- Kept preview/TestFlight build numbers unique per PR by time-stamping them, preventing bundle version collisions on reruns.
- Bumped project version metadata for the new release.
