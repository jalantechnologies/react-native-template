# Release Notes

## Highlights
- Automated version bump now derives the latest main branch version, increments it, and renames the matching release notes file for the build.
- Release notes validation runs first to ensure a file exists and contains content before any deployment steps.
- Android preview builds consume the bumped package metadata so Gradle and Fastlane use the updated version name and code during distribution.

## Fixes & Improvements
- Removed redundant repository checkouts in deploy steps so workflow-provided artifacts remain intact.
- Streamlined workflow dependencies to run Android builds only after version bumping and release note processing complete.
- Clarified release note handling to pass the renamed file directly to Firebase App Distribution.
