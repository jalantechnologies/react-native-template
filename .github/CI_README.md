# ðŸ“¦ CI/CD Pipeline Overview

This repository uses **GitHub Actions** combined with **Fastlane** to automate the build, testing, and deployment process for the Android app. The primary goals of this CI/CD setup are:

- ðŸš€ **Fast feedback** on pull requests by distributing builds via **Google Play Console Internal Testing track**.
- ðŸ§¹ **Automatic cleanup** of test builds when a PR is closed.
- ðŸ”’ **Secure handling** of credentials using **GitHub Actions Secrets**.

This ensures contributors and QA can quickly test PR builds without manually compiling the app, and stale builds are cleaned up automatically.

## ðŸš€ CI Workflow Summary

### 1. ðŸ”„ PR Build & Deploy to Google Play Internal Testing

**Why?**  
To enable quick testing and feedback for each PR by distributing `.aab` builds to testers on the **Google Play Console Internal Testing track**.

**How?**
- Triggered on PR open, reopen, or update (`pull_request` events)
- Uses Fastlaneâ€™s `pr_deploy` lane to:
  - Build the `.aab` with Gradle (`bundleRelease`)
  - Upload the `.aab` to **Google Play Console Internal Testing track** via Google Play API
  - Set release notes with the PR number and title
  - Comment on the PR with the release details (URL, build info)

---

### 2. ðŸ§¹ Google Play Cleanup on PR Close

**Why?**  
To prevent clutter in Google Play Console Internal Testing by automatically removing builds for closed PRs.

**How?**
- Triggered on PR close (`pull_request.closed`)
- Uses Fastlaneâ€™s `pr_cleanup` lane to:
  - Authenticate with Google Play Console using the service account
  - Fetch releases with matching PR identifiers in their release notes
  - Call the Google Play Console API to delete the releases

---

## ðŸ§ª Local Testing

You can test CI/CD behavior locally using Fastlane to simulate the GitHub Actions environment.

### Deploy a PR build:

```bash
cd android
bundle exec fastlane android pr_deploy \
  pr_number:123 \
  json_key_file:"<GPLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_JSON>" \
  package_name:"<ANDROID_APP_PACKAGE>"
