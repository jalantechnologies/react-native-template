# ðŸ“¦ CI/CD Pipeline Overview

This repository uses **GitHub Actions** combined with **Fastlane** to automate the build, testing, and deployment process for the Android app. The primary goals of this CI/CD setup are:

- ðŸš€ **Fast feedback** on pull requests by distributing builds via **Firebase App Distribution**
- ðŸ§¹ **Automatic cleanup** of test builds when a PR is closed
- ðŸ”’ **Secure handling** of credentials using **GitHub Actions Secrets**

This ensures contributors and QA can quickly test PR builds without manually compiling the app, and stale builds are cleaned up automatically.

## ðŸ”§ Environment Variables

These environment variables are used by the GitHub Actions workflows and Fastlane scripts to authenticate, configure builds, and upload to Firebase or Google Play.

| Name                            | Source                | Description                                                                                                                                         |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `FIREBASE_PROJECT_NUMBER`       | GitHub Actions `env:` | Firebase project number. Used in Firebase API endpoints for uploading and managing app distribution releases.                                      |
| `FIREBASE_APP_ID`               | GitHub Actions `env:` | Unique Firebase Android App ID. Used in Firebase App Distribution API calls to associate the build with the correct app.                           |
| `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`           | GitHub Actions `env:` | Firebase project ID. Used in Firebase CLI and Firebase Console URLs. Also helpful for identifying the correct project context in scripts.          |
| `FIREBASE_APP_PACKAGE`          | GitHub Actions `env:` | Android app package name (e.g., `com.example.app`). Used during Gradle builds and as an identifier when uploading builds to Firebase.              |
| `GCP_JSON_BASE64`               | GitHub Secret         | Base64-encoded GCP service account JSON. Decoded and written to `/tmp/gcp_key.json` to authenticate `gcloud` and Firebase App Distribution APIs.   |
| `GPLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_JSON` | GitHub Secret        | Base64-encoded JSON for Google Play Service Account. Used for uploading APKs/AABs to Google Play (used in Play Store lanes, if configured).        |
| `KEYSTORE_FILE`                 | GitHub Secret         | Base64-encoded Android signing keystore file. Required for signing release builds. Decoded during build and used in Gradle signing config.        |
| `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`             | GitHub Secret         | Password for the keystore file. Used in Gradle signing config for authenticating the keystore.                                                     |
| `KEY_ALIAS`                     | GitHub Secret         | Alias of the key inside the keystore. Used by Gradle to identify the correct signing key.                                                          |
| `KEY_PASSWORD`                  | GitHub Secret         | Password for the key alias. Used by Gradle to sign the APK with the specified key.                                                                 |

These variables are decoded and written to disk during the CI process so tools like Fastlane or the Firebase CLI can use them.

## ðŸš€ CI Workflow Summary

### 1. ðŸ”„ PR Build & Deploy to Firebase App Distribution

**Why?**  
To enable quick testing and feedback for each PR by distributing debug builds to Firebase testers.

**How?**
- Triggered on PR open, reopen, or update (`pull_request` events)
- Uses Fastlaneâ€™s `pr_deploy` lane to:
  - Build the APK with Gradle (`assembleDebug`)
  - Upload the APK to Firebase App Distribution via Firebase API
  - Set release notes with the PR number and title
  - Comment on the PR with the release details (URL, build info)

---

### 2. ðŸ§¹ Firebase Cleanup on PR Close

**Why?**  
To prevent clutter in Firebase App Distribution by automatically removing builds for closed PRs.

**How?**
- Triggered on PR close (`pull_request.closed`)
- Uses Fastlaneâ€™s `pr_cleanup` lane to:
  - Authenticate with Firebase using the same service account
  - Fetch releases with matching PR identifiers in their release notes
  - Call the Firebase App Distribution `batchDelete` API to remove them

---

## ðŸ§ª Local Testing

You can test CI/CD behavior locally using Fastlane to simulate the GitHub Actions environment.

### Deploy a PR build:

```bash
cd android
bundle exec fastlane android pr_deploy \
  pr_number:123 \
  pr_title:"Fix login bug" \
  project_number:"<FIREBASE_PROJECT_NUMBER>" \
  app_id:"<FIREBASE_APP_ID>"
