# Release Notes

## Highlights
- Automated version bump pulls the latest main branch version, increments it, and renames the matching release notes for builds.
- Release notes validation runs before any deployment steps and feeds the content into Play Store and Firebase changelogs.
- Android builds now read version name/code from package.json so Gradle and Fastlane publish consistent artifacts end to end.
