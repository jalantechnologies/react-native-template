## 1.0.2

- Added automation to ensure Google Play releases reuse the `docs/release_notes/<version>.md` content when a workflow does not provide custom notes.
- Verified version bump workflow by updating `package.json` to match these release notes.
- Seeded the Fastlane metadata `default.txt` changelog so initial Google Play uploads also include these release notes.
