# Generates a preview build for a pull request and uploads it to Firebase App Distribution.
#
# This supports QA and review workflows by automating the process of building an APK,
# uploading it to Firebase, and attaching metadata to identify it with a specific PR.
#
# Releases are tagged with PR metadata (number, title) so they can be surfaced contextually,
# and later cleaned up automatically when the PR is closed or merged.
#
# @param pr_number [String] The pull request number (used in release notes and cleanup)
# @param pr_title [String] The pull request title (used in release notes for context)
# @param project_number [String] Firebase project number
# @param app_id [String] Firebase app ID
# @param service_account_path [String] Path to the GCP service account JSON key
