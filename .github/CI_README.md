## üß™ PR Build & Firebase Deployment

- Triggered when a pull request is opened or updated.
- Builds a debug APK and uploads it to Firebase App Distribution.
- Comments on the PR with a link to the release.

### Firebase-specific params:
These are passed from the CI config and **must not be hardcoded**:

- `FIREBASE_PROJECT_NUMBER`
- `FIREBASE_APP_ID`



## üßπ Cleanup (on PR Close)

When a PR is closed, we:

- Search Firebase for matching test builds (based on PR number)
- Delete those test builds via Firebase API

---

## üìÅ Workflow Files

- `.github/workflows/pr_app_distribute.yml` ‚Äì Handles PR Firebase deploy + cleanup + Play Store
- `Fastfile` ‚Äì Contains Fastlane lanes:
  - `pr_deploy_firebase`
  - `pr_cleanup`

## ü§ù Contribution Guidelines

When modifying CI/CD setup:
- Use environment variables or GitHub secrets for all sensitive/unique config
- Do not hardcode `project_number`, `app_id`, or secrets
- Update this README if pipeline changes
