# ðŸ“¦ CI/CD Pipeline Overview

This repository uses **GitHub Actions** combined with **Fastlane** to automate the build, testing, and deployment process for the Android app. The primary goals of this CI/CD setup are:

- ðŸš€ **Fast feedback** on pull requests by distributing builds via **Firebase App Distribution**
- ðŸ§¹ **Automatic cleanup** of test builds when a PR is closed
- ðŸ”’ **Secure handling** of credentials using **GitHub Actions Secrets**

This ensures contributors and QA can quickly test PR builds without manually compiling the app, and stale builds are cleaned up automatically.

## ðŸ”§ Environment Variables

These environment variables are used by the GitHub Actions workflows and Fastlane scripts to authenticate, configure builds, and upload to Firebase or Google Play.

## ðŸš€ CI Workflow Summary

### 1.  PR Build & Deploy to Firebase App Distribution

**Why?**  
To enable quick testing and feedback for each PR by distributing debug builds to Firebase testers.

**How?**
- Triggered on PR open, reopen, or update (`pull_request` events)
- Uses Fastlaneâ€™s `pr_deploy` lane to:
  - Build the APK with Gradle (`assembleDebug`)
  - Upload the APK to Firebase App Distribution via Firebase API
  - Set release notes with the PR number and title
  - Comment on the PR with the release details (URL, build info)

---

### 2.  Firebase Cleanup on PR Close

**Why?**  
To prevent clutter in Firebase App Distribution by automatically removing builds for closed PRs.

**How?**
- Triggered on PR close (`pull_request.closed`)
- Uses Fastlaneâ€™s `pr_cleanup` lane to:
  - Authenticate with Firebase using the same service account
  - Fetch releases with matching PR identifiers in their release notes
  - Call the Firebase App Distribution `batchDelete` API to remove them

---
### 3.  PR Build & Deploy to TestFlight (iOS)

**Why?**  
To make iOS preview builds available for testing via TestFlight for every active PR.

**How?**
- Triggered on PR open, reopen, or update (`pull_request` events)  
- Uses Fastlaneâ€™s `ios/pr_deploy` lane to:
  - Fetch iOS signing certificates and provisioning profiles using Fastlane Match
  - Build the app using Xcode with `build_app`
  - Upload the build to TestFlight via `upload_to_testflight`
  - Comment on the PR with the TestFlight link and build metadata (App ID, build hash)

---

### 4. TestFlight Cleanup on PR Close (iOS)

**Why?**  
To automatically remove TestFlight builds for closed PRs, keeping TestFlight builds relevant and minimal.

**How?**
- Triggered on PR close (`pull_request.closed`)  
- Uses Fastlaneâ€™s `ios/pr_cleanup` lane to:
  - Authenticate with App Store Connect via API Key
  - Identify and remove the TestFlight build associated with the closed PR
  - Helps maintain a clean TestFlight history and avoids orphaned builds

##  Local Testing

You can test CI/CD behavior locally using Fastlane to simulate the GitHub Actions environment.

### Deploy a PR build:

```bash
cd android
bundle exec fastlane android pr_deploy \
  pr_number:123 \
  pr_title:"Fix login bug" \
  project_number:"<FIREBASE_PROJECT_NUMBER>" \
  app_id:"<FIREBASE_APP_ID>"
