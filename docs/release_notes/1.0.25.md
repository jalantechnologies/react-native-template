### CI/CD automation update
- Added post-merge auto version bump on `main` using semver labels from merged PRs.
- `release_notes.md` is now rotated to `docs/release_notes/<version>.md` during bump, then reset with a fresh template.
- Production and permanent preview run only from the bump commit push.
- Version bump uses `Better Software-version-bump-bot` with branch-rule bypass.
- Updated CD/automation docs with fork setup and required app permissions.
