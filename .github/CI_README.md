# ðŸ“¦ CI/CD Pipeline Overview

This repository uses **GitHub Actions** combined with **Fastlane** to automate the build, testing, and deployment process for the Android app. The primary goals of this CI/CD setup are:

- ðŸš€ **Fast feedback** on pull requests by distributing builds via **Firebase App Distribution**
- ðŸ§¹ **Automatic cleanup** of test builds when a PR is closed
- ðŸ”’ **Secure handling** of credentials using **GitHub Actions Secrets**

This ensures contributors and QA can quickly test PR builds without manually compiling the app, and stale builds are cleaned up automatically.

## ðŸ”§ Environment Variables

These environment variables are used by the GitHub Actions workflows and Fastlane scripts to authenticate, configure builds, and upload to Firebase or Google Play.

| Name                            | Source                | Description                                                                                                                                         |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ANDROID_FIREBASE_PROJECT_NUMBER`       | GitHub Secret  | Firebase project number. Used in Firebase API endpoints for uploading and managing app distribution releases.                                      |
| `ANDROID_FIREBASE_APP_ID`               | GitHub Secret | Unique Firebase Android App ID. Used in Firebase App Distribution API calls to associate the build with the correct app.                           |
| `ANDROID_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`           | GitHub Secret | Firebase project ID. Used in Firebase CLI and Firebase Console URLs. Also helpful for identifying the correct project context in scripts.          |
| `ANDROID_FIREBASE_APP_PACKAGE`          | GitHub Secret | Android app package name (e.g., `com.example.app`). Used during Gradle builds and as an identifier when uploading builds to Firebase.              |
| `ANDROID_GCP_JSON_BASE64`               | GitHub Secret         | Base64-encoded GCP service account JSON. Decoded and written to `/tmp/gcp_key.json` to authenticate `gcloud` and Firebase App Distribution APIs.   |                                                                |
| `ANDROID_FIREBASE_API_KEY`             | GitHub Secret         | Firebase Web API key used by the push notification system (e.g., FCM). Typically accessed by the app or backend to interact with Firebase services like messaging. |
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_FILE`           | GitHub Secret  | Base64-encoded Android keystore file. Decoded and used to sign Android builds during Firebase and Play Store deployments. |
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`       | GitHub Secret  | Password for the Android keystore file used in signing builds. |
| `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`               | GitHub Secret  | Alias used inside the keystore to refer to the signing key. |
| `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`            | GitHub Secret  | Password for the key alias used in Android app signing. |
| `DOPPLER_PREVIEW_TOKEN`           | GitHub Secret  | Used to inject preview environment secrets via Doppler during PR builds and checks. |
| `DOPPLER_PRODUCTION_TOKEN`        | GitHub Secret  | Used to inject production environment secrets via Doppler during production builds and checks. |
| `DOCKER_PASSWORD`                 | GitHub Secret  | Docker registry password used for authenticating image pulls and pushes in CI. |
| `GPLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_JSON`  | GitHub Secret  | Google Play service account key for uploading Android production builds via Fastlane and GitHub Action. |
| `SONAR_TOKEN`                     | GitHub Secret  | Authentication token for SonarQube analysis API access. |
| `SONAR_HOST_URL`                  | GitHub Secret  | URL of your SonarQube server used in PR and branch scan jobs. |

These variables are decoded and written to disk during the CI process so tools like Fastlane or the Firebase CLI can use them.

## ðŸš€ CI Workflow Summary

### 1. ðŸ”„ PR Build & Deploy to Firebase App Distribution

**Why?**  
To enable quick testing and feedback for each PR by distributing debug builds to Firebase testers.

**How?**
- Triggered on PR open, reopen, or update (`pull_request` events)
- Uses Fastlaneâ€™s `pr_deploy` lane to:
  - Build the APK with Gradle (`assembleDebug`)
  - Upload the APK to Firebase App Distribution via Firebase API
  - Set release notes with the PR number and title
  - Comment on the PR with the release details (URL, build info)

---

### 2. ðŸ§¹ Firebase Cleanup on PR Close

**Why?**  
To prevent clutter in Firebase App Distribution by automatically removing builds for closed PRs.

**How?**
- Triggered on PR close (`pull_request.closed`)
- Uses Fastlaneâ€™s `pr_cleanup` lane to:
  - Authenticate with Firebase using the same service account
  - Fetch releases with matching PR identifiers in their release notes
  - Call the Firebase App Distribution `batchDelete` API to remove them

## ðŸ§ª Local Testing

You can test CI/CD behavior locally using Fastlane to simulate the GitHub Actions environment.

### Deploy a PR build:

```bash
cd android
bundle exec fastlane android pr_deploy \
  pr_number:123 \
  pr_title:"Fix login bug" \
  project_number:"<FIREBASE_PROJECT_NUMBER>" \
  app_id:"<FIREBASE_APP_ID>"
