Automated version bumps now read the latest version from main, increment it, and rename matching release notes for builds.
Release note validation runs before deployments to ensure notes exist and contain content.
Android builds pull the bumped version name/code into Gradle and Fastlane so releases align with package metadata.
Release artifacts reuse workflow-provided files to avoid overwriting versioned outputs during deployment.
